SIGTERM politely asks the process to exit - this signal can be caught; allows
  for controlled clean-up tasks such as closing any open files.
SIGKILL shoots the process point blank - this signal cannot be caught, and
  the process WILL exit then and there. Useful for when a program has frozen.
These can be invoked by kill [pid] and kill -9 [pid], respectively.

Ctrl+C sends SIGINT to a terminal process. This signal is often used to
  terminate a running script or cancel an action.
