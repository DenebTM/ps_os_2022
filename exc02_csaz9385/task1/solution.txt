Set environment variable for the shell:
    MY_ENV_VAR=[value]
Make environment variable available to child processes (e.g. our program):
    export MY_ENV_VAR
    May also be combined with setting a variable:
      export MY_ENV_VAR=[value]
Delete environment variable:
    unset MY_ENV_VAR
Set variable only for a specific command:
    MY_ENV_VAR=[value] [command]

The PATH environment variable contains a :-separated list of all locations on
the system (subfolders not included) where the shell will look for executable
files. Executables placed in locations listed in PATH can be run simply by
typing their name instead of their full or relative path, providing easy access
to them.
PATH locations are searched starting from the beginning - this can be used to
"override" executables by placing them in a directory that is searched earlier.
