Incrementing the global variable in the child process does not affect the same
variable in its parent process. Doing the same within a pthread does. This is
because pthreads aren't full processes and are required by the POSIX standard
to share many things with their creator including global variables, while child
processes receive a copy of their parent's memory segment at creation.
