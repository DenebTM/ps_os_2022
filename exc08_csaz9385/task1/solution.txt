A thread pool offers a pool of consumer threads - they "consume" jobs that you
give them. The producer in this case is any other thread giving out those jobs.

Using a pool is much faster, but I'm also only creating 128 threads for my 
pool - which is a less ridiculous number than 50,000 (or 30,000 in my case, as
the limit on Linux 5.16.16-arch1-1 appears to be somewhere around 32,700).
