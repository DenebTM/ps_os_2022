With a small number of samples (around 1000) and children (3), the output is
generally consistent, and in order of creation (child 0, 1, 2). With increasing
sample sizes and number of children, the correleation between the time a child
is created and the time it finishes becomes weaker.

The order of execution cannot be reliably predicted, as it is up to the
operating system to schedule allotment of CPU time.

Yes, the random number generator must be seeded after child creation in order
for their values to differ. Otherwise each child "inherits" it from the parent
and each call to rand() will return the same value in every process.
